I thought that there may be other people out there who are running a Linux machine within an otherwise Windows-based (Active Directory) network, like I do in work. At my workplace we are forced to change our passwords every month which is a tedious process without having something to automate it so that's the reason for me creating this script which lets you reset your Active Directory, cntlm (NTLM/Windows LAN authentication proxy) and your local Linux user passwords easily from the comfort of your terminal. Hopefully someone else finds it useful!
